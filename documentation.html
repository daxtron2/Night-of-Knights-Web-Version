    Documentation Page
    
    Your documentation page should be integrated into the site through both design and navigation. It should describe what technologies and techniques you used to create the site, what you had to learn in order to complete it, and how you went "above and beyond" the basic functionality that we covered in our in-class exercises. You should list and link to any libraries or other online resources that you incorporated, as well as any examples that inspired you. If you worked with a partner, you should have separate sections for each person describing what you worked on and what you learned in order to do it.
