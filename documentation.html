            Welcome to the documentation page for Night of Knights: Web Version! This site hosts three different versions of the game, created with the JavaScript framework <a href="https://phaser.io">Phaser</a>. In order to create this project, we had to learn about how Phaser many different systems work in conjunction with one another. Many of the assets were already made as we took them from our old project for GDAPS2, which allowed us to focus on the code and design of how the game plays. Our original idea was to recreate, as accurately as possible, our original game. Instead, we ended up using what we learned from IGME-230 to create something more suitabl to a browser based environment and web userbase. Every bit of this project was created by us, no code, images, sounds, or animations were from an outside source. Versions 2 and 3 of the game both use version 1 as a baseline, and then add extra features to make them play / look different.

            <h2>Mike Schek's Efforts and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p class="indiv">
                While working on the project, I primarily focused on getting the player character functioning in the first iteration of the project. This involved learning how to use the phaser
                 framework to have sprites moving and playing sprite animations, specifically for movement and attacking. While working on getting the player movement functioning I also worked on 
                 the physics of the player movement, and limiting character functionality, such that the player would not be able to jump high in the air several times in succession. I 
                 also assisted with tweaking some of the combat mechanics such as the way in which the enemy knight moves towards the player so that it does not bounce back and forth, a
                 nd instead stops at a certain range. I also worked on getting the base setup for the melee knight enemy in place, such as health and physics. In addition to the portions of the 
                 first iteration that I worked on, I also wrote the additions to the game that were put in place for the second iteration. I designed the second iteration such that a new type of
                  enemy, the ranged archer, spawns in on either end of the screen after the melee knight has been killed ten times. This new enemy fires an arrow projectile in the direction of the 
                  player, which causes damage to the player if the two sprites overlap. Along with these specific tasks, I also worked on general bug fixes and optimizations for the game throughout the 
                  project, and worked with Tj on several bugs that I was not able to finish on my own.
