# Night-of-Knights-Web-Version
# Description: 
For this project, we will be recreating our GDAPS2 game in Phaser, a JavaScript framework for desktop and mobile game development. There will be 3 different versions of the game, each with different properties that make the game play in different ways. We chose to recreate our GDAPS2 game, Night of Knights, because it allowed us to have a product that we know how it should feel, and what we can do differently to make it web and mobile friendly. Night of Knights is an 2D sidescroller in which you control a knight, fighting endless waves of enemies. There are 3 different enemy types, A knight, an archer, and the Archmage. The archer and archmage both use ranged attack styles while the knight is a melee fighter. The player earns points by killing these enemies and advancing forward. Almost all of the assets for our recreation and improvements are already made, allowing us to focus on the design, balancing, and coding aspects of this particular project.

# Responsibilities: 
- Both:
  - Recreating the original game in JavaScript using the Phaser framework
  - Each of us will create our own separate, “improved” version of the game in order to test out different features and functionalities more quickly.
- In the end, we should have 3 distinct versions.
  - One which is a recreation of the original
  - One with features created by TJ to improve the original
  - One with features created by Mike to improve the original

# Need to learn: 
The various built in functions of Phaser that will allow us to accurately recreate and improve upon our original design.
