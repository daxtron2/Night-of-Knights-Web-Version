    Main Landing Page
    
    Your main (navigation) page should show as much attention to design as your individual application pages. It should include descriptions of and links to each of the three application pages, as well as a link to your documentation page. If you worked with a partner, this page should also explain who was responsible for each aspect of the design and implementation. You should also provide some form of JavaScript-based interactivity on this page--but make sure that it adds value to the page in some way, rather than being gratuitous. (Some possibilities would be enhanced navigation using JS, or the ability for users to customize the page.)
